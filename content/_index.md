I enjoy tackling the challenges that come with game development, as each project brings new opportunities to learn and grow. I also have a strong interest in backend development, particularly in managing data and designing how information flows through a system. With 4 years of experience programming games, Iâ€™ve come to value not only the creative process but also the technical journey from early development all the way to publishing.

# Introduction
These are some of the game jam projects I’ve worked on. They were made in teams of 2–5 people, with development times ranging from 2 to 14 days.  

### Skills Gained
- Working in small teams under tight deadlines  
- Taking on leadership roles when needed  
- Experimenting with different mechanics, such as a modular ship-building system

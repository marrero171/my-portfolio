# Introduction
These games are some of the game jam projects I have participated in. They were done in teams of 2-5 people and have ranged from 2-14 days.

### Skills learned
- Developed teamwork and working against the clock
- Learned leadership skills under pressure
- Learned how to design intricate game systems, such as a modular ship-building feature.

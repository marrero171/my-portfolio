## Introduction
I developed this app for my uncle to solve a specific problem that was being experienced in the shooting range. Targetting machines are very expensive and the range was missing a way to practice without manual intervention of the targets. I developed this to help during that training by automatically controlling the targets with a controller and the app via bluetooth. The app narrates the instructions, beeps, and moves the target according to predefined rules, having many options for different kinds of competition.

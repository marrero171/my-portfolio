## Introduction
I developed this app for my uncle to solve a specific problem that was being experienced in the shooting range. Targetting machines are very expensive and the range was missing a way to practice without manual intervention of the targets. I developed this to help during that training by automatically controlling the targets with a controller and the app via bluetooth. The app narrates the instructions, beeps, and moves the target according to predefined rules, having many options for different kinds of competition.

## Things I Learned
This is technically the second rewrite of the app, the first one being made in Java with Android Studio. I decided to try a new technology this time around and used Flutter with Dart. This let me have the option of cross platform support in the future.
I also learned how to make use of permissions and bluetooth on modern Android devices, as well as building apk for them.
It was thrilling to see something I built control a physical device like that, with no need to manually control them.

### Other things I learned
- Localization (Spanish and english)
- Saving settings within the app
- The latest features Android API has to offer (Such as predictive back gestures and stricter permissions)

## Introduction
This project was started in the third year of my time in University of Puerto Rico - Arecibo, and was the final project before graduating. It started as a 5 team project, then gradually was split into 2 teams. My team spent their time doing the counselor part of the project, and a bit of the student and admin parts. I learned a lot from this project and is by far the best learning experience I've had.

## What is this app for?
This app was designed to help counselors of PSE in the University of Puerto Rico to manage and schedule appointments with students through simple interface, eliminating the need to use paperwork, as it has been done for many years.

## Things I learned

- **Docker Composer:** I learned how to create my own Dockerfiles to get the app working in a containerized environment, facilitating deployment and the need to manually install all these dependencies.
- **Python:** I got a much deeper experience with python and learned a lot of the details that you don't get when learning through small projects.
- **HTML and templating:** We used Jinja templates which made creating static pages less time consuming, and more standardized.
- **Celery:** I implemented asynchronous tasks using celery, for example, to send emails in a predetermined time.
- **Flask:** I got to learn more about Flask and different patterns used. In this instance, we used Application Factory.
- **MVC pattern:** This project was built with the MVC pattern, and the model part was by far the most fun, doing data manipulation.

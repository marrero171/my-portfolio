# Introduction
Hi, I'm Francisco Marrero. I am a Game Developer and Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience creating games and 3 years of experience building web applications. Over the years, I’ve published multiple game prototypes, participated in several game jams, and contributed to projects at the University of Puerto Rico – Arecibo, where my team developed a scheduling system for the PSE (Programa de Servicios Educativos).  

Game development has been a long-standing passion of mine. Beyond the technical challenges, I value the creativity, teamwork, and leadership that come from collaborating under tight deadlines. These experiences have strengthened not only my problem-solving skills but also my ability to adapt and learn quickly.  

At UPR – Arecibo, I focused on web development using PHP, Tailwind CSS, and other modern technologies, expanding my expertise into backend systems, data management, and full-stack development.

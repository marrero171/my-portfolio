# Introduction
Hi, I'm Francisco Marrero. I have 4 years of experience in game development, having published multiple prototypes over the years and participating in several game jams. I also have 2 years of experience as a Fullstack Developer in the University of Puerto Rico - Arecibo, on which our team made a scheduling system for the PSE (Programa de Servicios Educativos).

Game Development has been a passion for me for a long time, and recently I've been taking steps towards my personal goals while also having fun in the community, and working with other people in the field. These game jams have helped shape my knowledge and has taught me teamwork and leadership during stressfull time.

I am studying at the University of Puerto Rico - Arecibo, currently working as a web developer using PHP, tailwind css, and various other technologies.
